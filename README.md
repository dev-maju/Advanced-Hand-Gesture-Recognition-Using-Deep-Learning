# Advanced-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe landmarks and an LSTM-based deep learning model. Normalized temporal sequences enable robust gesture classification with 97% accuracy. The system runs in real time on a standard laptop for efficient human–computer interaction.
